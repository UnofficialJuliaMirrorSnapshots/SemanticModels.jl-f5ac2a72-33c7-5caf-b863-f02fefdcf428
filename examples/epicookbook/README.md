# Epicookbook example

This folder contains an example of using the SemanticModels.jl package for analyzing scientific codes and building
scientist augmentation programs.

## Original Sources

We are grateful to the authors of all these sources, without their contributions to open science, we would not be able
to build this technology.

## Motivation

Epidemiological models are flexible and well specified. The epicookbook represents a secondary text that explains how to
build epidemiological models from the ground up. The models are in increasing complexity and have code associated with
them. These code examples are often written in multiple languages, which makes them a great test case for our software.

## Getting Started

Here is how to run the example:
