program_interpretable,math_function,"A function is a relationthat uniquely associates members of one set with members of another set. More formally, a function from A to B is an object f such that every a in A is uniquely associated with an object f(a) in B. A function is therefore a many-to-one (or sometimes one-to-one) relation.",http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Function.html
program_interpretable,program,A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program
program_interpretable,type,"In computer science and computer programming, a type is an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support common data types of real, integerand boolean. A data type constrains the values that an expression, such as a variable or a function, might take. This data type defines the operations that can be done on the data, the meaning of the data, and the way values of that type can be stored. ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type
program_interpretable,control_flow_block,"A control flow statement is a statement, the execution of which results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths to follow. A set of statements is in turn generally structured as a block, which in addition to grouping, also defines a lexical scope.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow
program_interpretable,variable,A name associated (or bound) to a value; the left-hand side of an assignment operation.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_variable
program_interpretable,numeric_value,A quantitative value.,Defined by ASKE team.
program_interpretable,code_function,"In computer science, a function is an object that maps a tuple of arguments to a return value, or throws an exception if no appropriate value can be returned.",https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.0/manual/methods/#Methods-1
program_interpretable,code_method,"A definition of one possible behavior for a function is called a method. The ignatures of method definitions can be annotated to indicate the types of arguments in addition to their number, and more than a single method definition may be provided. When a function is applied to a particular tuple of arguments, the most specific method applicable to those arguments is applied. Thus, the overall behavior of a function is a patchwork of the behaviors of its various method definitions. If the patchwork is well designed, even though the implementations of the methods may be quite different, the outward behavior of the function will appear seamless and consistent.",https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.0/manual/methods/#Methods-1
program_interpretable,argument,"In computer science, an argument is the actual input expression passed/supplied to a function, procedure, or routine in the invocation/call statement.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)
program_interpretable,argument_tuple,"The tuple of input expression(s) passed/supplied to a function, procedure, or routine in the invocation/call statement.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)
program_interpretable,return_value,"The value returned by a function is the value of the last expression evaluated, which, by default, is the last expression in the body of the function definition.",
program_interpretable,return_tuple,"The tuple of value(s) returned by a function are the value(s) of the last expression evaluated, which, by default, is the last expression in the body of the function definition. In Julia, one returns a tuple of values to simulate returning multiple values. ",https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/
program_interpretable,property,An attribute or characteristic.,Defined by ASKE team.
domain_interpretable,unit,"A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of the same kind of quantity. Any other quantity of that kind can be expressed as a multiple of the unit of measurement.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement
domain_interpretable,collection,"A collection (n>1) of objects measured in (and/or convertible to, through dimensional analysis) a specific unit.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement
domain_interpretable,independent_variable,"A variable manipulated by an experimenter is called an independent variable. Depending on the context, an independent variable is sometimes called a ""predictor variable"", regressor, covariate, ""controlled variable"", ""manipulated variable"", ""explanatory variable"", exposure variable (see reliability theory), ""risk factor"" (see medical statistics), ""feature"" (in machine learning and pattern recognition) or ""input variable.""] In econometrics, the term ""control variable"" is usually used instead of ""covariate"".",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables
domain_interpretable,dependent_variable,"The variable(s) that represent the output or outcome whose variation is being studied. Depending on the context, a dependent variable is sometimes called a ""response variable"", ""regressand"", ""criterion"", ""predicted variable"", ""measured variable"", ""explained variable"", ""experimental variable"", ""responding variable"", ""outcome variable"", ""output variable"" or ""label"".",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables
domain_interpretable,mathematical_model,"A mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language. A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model
domain_interpretable,concept,"A scientific or mathematical idea, mental representation, abstract object, etc. Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed ""superordinate"" and lower levels termed ""subordinate"". Additionally, there is the ""basic"" or ""middle"" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept
julia_intermediate,Expr,"A Julia type that represents an expression object. Expr objects contain two parts: a Symbol identifying the kind of expression, and the expression arguments, which may be symbols, other expressions, or literal values.",https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/index.html#Program-representation-1
